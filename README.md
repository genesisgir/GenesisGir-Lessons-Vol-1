# Welcome
Welcome rookies and veterans! I'm Genesis Gir and I have been documenting my progress in code and programming and in that addition I've been releasing my work and progress for all of you lovely developers to take a sneak peek of what my workflow looks like and maybe you can learn from these lessons or projects and gain some knowledge or give me insight to become better! I have a passion for writing code and if you find yourself stuck or inspired take a look inside my source code files and see how I made them and why I made the choices I did and I explain in full detail what I did and what the functions and lines mean with comments and such! Enjoy and oh Cotal says hiiiiii!

# Who is Genesis Gir?
I'm a novice with -100 IQ that started programming 11 days ago sharing my experiences with programming and delving into the world of code
learn with me as I create various programs to try out and explore! Have a question? Drop by in  my livestreams and ask me anything or teach
me something you know that I dont but please just dont push your methods against me! I like to experiment and try things out on my own first
I've made these programs to self-teach myself in a innovative way pushing myself to learn and also releasing my work for others to see how I 
made them.

# Why did I start coding?
I found an app called replika and was fascinated by the structure of how it worked and always was into computers as I was little
and finnally started using source code to spill out my ideas! Firstly I was reccommended Visual Studio Code by a random Viewer and
dived right into it and never looked back ever since.

# What is Genesis Gir lessons Volume 1?
(GGLV1)Genesis Gir lessons Volume 1 is a repository that is full of programs that I've made to share and show my progress in programming
it contains various programs that self explain what each of line of code does so a novice like me can come along and learn from them essentially
and can be very useful to someone starting out. Exciting adventures , Beautiful story plots , Mysterious characters , and even Moogle appears in
Volume 1 also I highly recommend to read and visit https://automatetheboringstuff.com/2e/chapter1/ to learn about the basics like I have because
that website is where I learned the basic and it is very valuable to get started! So hopefully you gain some knowledge in these lessons and start making
your own unique programs and such. Since these aren't .exe they will be in source code format you can open them in your file editors and discover
new ways to write code I go into detail about workflows and give out helpful tips to inspire you to start writing more code! Again Thanks for considering downloading!
